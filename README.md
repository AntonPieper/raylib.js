# Raylib.js

Alternative implementation of [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) API entirely in JavaScript so you can use it from WebAssembly. Intended as a simplier Web version of Raylib that does not require Emscripten. **Not fully implemented yet!**

## Quick Start

```console
$ make
$ python3 -m http.server 6969
$ <browser> http://localhost:6969/
```
