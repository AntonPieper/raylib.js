# Raylib.js

Alternative implementation of [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) API entirely in JavaScript so you can use it from WebAssembly. Intended as a simplier Web version of Raylib that does not require Emscripten. 

**WARNING! Not fully implemented yet! This is a Research Project and not guaranteed to be useful in present or/and future!**
